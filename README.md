# CE888-Imbalanced-dataset
This report explains the method to deal with imbalanced datasets. Balanced datasets have equal or almost equal number of instances among the classes whereas imbalanced datasets have great differences in instances of the class. The output of the datasets plays a major role. Main objective of using the datasets is to predict the accurate model, if the dataset is imbalanced then it will lead to inaccurate model. In real world scenario, a greater number of medical decisions and analysis about diseases are taken by the datasets, And also using the data analytics methods in finance, banking, security and other data related industry So the datasets model should provide the higher accuracy models. Imbalanced datasets could possibly create more impact on the real-world problems
